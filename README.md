# My Vue Menu 

This project started as a repo solely for my new Menu component, built from scratch using [Vue](https://vuejs.org/). 
Now it's become a sandbox for example components demonstrating the following useful tools: 

* Slideshow (built with [Slick](https://www.npmjs.com/package/vue-slick-carousel))
* Back To Top link (not visible at first, but then shows up after scrolling down a bit)
* Modal (build with [Vue JS Modal](https://www.npmjs.com/package/vue-js-modal)

## Here's how to run this project locally

### Project setup
```
npm install
```

### Compiles and hot-reloads for development
```
npm run serve
```
